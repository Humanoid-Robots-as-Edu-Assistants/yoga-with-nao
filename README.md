# "Yoga" for NAO robot [v.1.0]
*Attention: this project is only available in German!*


### About

Yoga with NAO is a short application in which NAO guides the users through three easy Asanas (Yoga stances). Itâ€™s useful for longer<br>
breaks during lessons with smaller groups. Especially after longer sessions of sitting, this application is helpful to get some easy <br>
movement and to regain focus. No previous knowledge about yoga is necessary, since NAO explains every stance carefully and shows the <br>
positions as accurately as possible. It is important to notice that NAO is restricted in its movement and can not show the stances without<br>
small adjustments. Even with verbal guidance,  it might be helpful to have additional pictures shown of the Asanas or have the instructor<br>
help to adjust feet/ leg positions.

### How the program works

After a short introduction, NAO starts with the Tadasana (Mountain pose), moves to the Virabhadrasana I (Warrior 1) for the right side <br>
and lastly the Virabhadrasana II (Warrior 2) also on the right side. For the right side, all body-part positions are explained carefully <br>
and are held for five slow breaths, which are counted by NAO. After that, NAO goes through the same routine but for the left side, <br>
this time only giving short guidance for a smoother transition in between stances.

### What do you need?<br>

You will need NAO robot and it could be useful to have additional pictures of the Asanas.

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
